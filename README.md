## Research

- Experiment with various technologies available to us and see which works the best for our project.
- Starting with web technologies such as React, experiment with various available SDKs and services.
- Flutter is a great tool for building mobile apps. Try it out and see how it works.
- If building a cross platform app is not an option, try building a native app.
- Start with android. Use various SDKs like Google Maps, Mapbox, etc.
- If android app development is a success, gather resources to build an iOS app and build it.

## Design

### Frontend

- Design a simple, intuitive, and easy to use app.
- First, focus on functionality.
- Once the app is fully functional, focus on design.
- Use Figma to design the app. Use a lot of animations and transitions.

### Backend

- The backend should be able to handle all the data and logic.
- It should be fast and performant.
- It is best to use a microservices style architecture.
- Here is a representational architecture of the backend.

## Development

- Once the experimentation part is complete, the rest of the work is very straightforward.
- The work can be distributed among the developers, and the process can go on in full tilt.
- Using Git and Docker, people can work on different parts of the application and be merged at the end.

## Technologies and Tools (tentative)

- Kotlin on Android Platform
- Mapbox SDK for maps and navigation services
- Supabase or Firebase for authentication
- React Admin app
- Node.JS based backend services
- PostgreSQL for database
- Linux based OS (Ubuntu, Arch etc)
- IntelliJ based IDEs (Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, WebStorm etc)
- Visual Studio Code based editors (CodeOSS, VSCodium etc)
- Android based smartphones for testing
